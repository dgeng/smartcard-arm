Smartcard Driver for the simputer is a driver for the Philips TDA8008
smartcard controller. It uses the ALPAR protocol to communicate
with the controller. The controller supports ISO7816-4 complaint cards
following the T=0 and T=1 protocol.

The Smartcard driver for the x86, is meant for the Philips TDA8008
development board. It uses the serial port to communicate with the
development board. In the case of the arm platform, the driver uses
a kernel module to communicate with the controller. This is because
a polling serial driver is used rather than the default interrupt-mode
serial driver in Linux. Currently, the smartcards that have been tested
include BULL-CP8, Schlumberger Payflex and Philips DS Personalization
cards. Use alpar_test to check communication with the controller.
